# Podman

Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and container images on your Linux System. It is a part of the libpod library, which is a set of tools for managing containers and images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made of groups of containers. Podman provides a Docker-CLI comparable command line that eases the transition from other container engines and allows the management of pods, containers, and images.
