# ðŸ§® Data Structure and Algorithms

## What is DSA?

DSA stands for Data Structure and Algorithms. It's a fundamental concept in computer science that focuses on organizing and storing data efficiently, and using algorithms to manage, manipulate, and perform operations on that data.

* **Data Structures** are ways of organizing data so it can be used effectively. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
* **Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem. Common algorithm types include sorting, searching, optimization, and dynamic programming.

Understanding DSA is crucial for developing efficient and optimized software solutions.
