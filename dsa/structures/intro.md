# Intro

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. Here are some common data structures:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Hash Tables

## Abstract Data Types

An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

## Complexity Analysis

Complexity analysis is a way to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm. It is a way to measure how an algorithm responds to an increase in the size of the input data. It is important to understand the complexity of an algorithm before using it in a real-world application. The complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed using big O notation.
