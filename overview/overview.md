C Programming Overview from chat-GPT

```
Introduction:
    C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs.
    It is a powerful and efficient language widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development.

Key Features:
    Mid-level language: Combines low-level control with high-level abstraction.
    Portability: Programs written in C can be compiled and executed on various platforms.
    Structured Language: Supports modular and organized programming with functions and blocks.
    Pointers: C allows direct memory manipulation using pointers, offering flexibility and efficiency.
    Standard Library: C provides a rich library of functions for various tasks.

Syntax:
    C code is written in plain text and consists of statements and functions.
    Statements are terminated with a semicolon, and blocks of code are enclosed in curly braces.
    Functions have a return type, name, optional parameters, and a body with executable code.

Variables and Data Types:
    C uses variables to store data. Before using a variable, it must be declared with a specific data type.
    Common data types include int (integer), float (floating-point), char (character), and double (double-precision floating-point).
    Custom data types can be created using structs and enums.

Control Flow:
    C supports control structures like if-else, switch-case, for loops, while loops, and do-while loops for decision making and looping.

Functions:
    Functions in C allow code reusability and modularization.
    They are defined with a return type, name, and optional parameters.
    Function calls can pass arguments to the function for processing.

Pointers:
    Pointers are variables that store memory addresses of other variables.
    They enable direct memory access and manipulation, making C efficient for certain tasks.

Memory Management:
    C provides manual memory management with functions like malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free().
    This level of control over memory can be both advantageous and challenging.

Standard Library:
    C comes with a standard library that provides various built-in functions for I/O, string manipulation, math operations, etc.

Preprocessor Directives:
    Preprocessor directives start with a '#' symbol and are processed before compilation.
    They are used for including header files, defining constants, and performing conditional compilation.
